 monoculAR Smart Augmented Reality Monocle is the first open Smart AR Monocle that uses VR techniques to display a AR image combining the best of both. 

We developed a lightweight companion app that shows your notifications on the monocle, and combining this with your voice assistant it creates the first fully hands free mobile visual interaction.

The monocle is open to recieve and display any text from any app. So if you want to use it directly with your app, you just need to connect to it via bluetooth or serial usb and send the text you desire followed by /n.

We want to make this project as a DIY solution so it can be made easily by who needs and at the same time set the bar for the prices of sets that will appear made industrially.

We are choosing a non commercial license because we want to garantee that there are conditions to keep a minimum team to keep the project centralized and going foward.
At the same time, because we dont want to be the reason the price raises we set our share at a residual value, being only the conscience of who uses it to raise it, helping even more the project.

Centralizing the project will help keep quality up and garantee a giant network working for the same goal.
